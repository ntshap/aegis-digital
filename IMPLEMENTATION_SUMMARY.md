# 🚀 Aegis Digital - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implemented Recommendations

### 1. 🔐 Smart Contract Security Validation
**Location**: `aegis-digital-contracts/contracts/AegisFileRegistry.sol`

**What was implemented**:
- Added validation to ensure filename is not empty in `registerFile` function
- Added validation to ensure IPFS hash is not empty
- Enhanced security with proper error handling

```solidity
require(bytes(_fileName).length > 0, "File name cannot be empty");
require(bytes(_ipfsHash).length > 0, "IPFS hash cannot be empty");
```

**Impact**: Prevents users from registering files with empty names or hashes, ensuring data integrity.
